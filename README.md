# Menu Mate 🍽️

**Menu Mate** is a simple and convenient web application that was originally created to provide the daily hostel mess menu for ITER (Institute of Technical Education and Research). It allows users to easily check today's menu and view tomorrow's menu in advance, making meal planning hassle-free for hostel residents.
